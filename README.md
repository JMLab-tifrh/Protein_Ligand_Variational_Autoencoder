This is the repository for variational autoencoder (VAE) and denoising convolutional VAE (DCVAE) written in tensorflow. Instructions to run the codes are in the "README.dat" file of the individual directories

----------REQUIRED PACKAGES----------

1. TensorFlow
2. NumPy 
3. Scikit-learn

----------PROGRAM INPUTS----------

For both VAE and DCVAE models, one requires a file that contains the training and testing data in *.npy format. 

----------PROGRAM OUTPUTS----------

A directory containing the training and validation loss and the model parameters.

----------HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM----------
1. VAE
